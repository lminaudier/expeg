# Expeg [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lminaudier/expeg.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lminaudier/expeg)

Attempt to write a PEG parser generator with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org)

See a growing example of the work in progress in [test/examples/arithmetic_test.exs](https://github.com/lminaudier/expeg/blob/master/test/examples/arithmetic_test.exs)

At the moment, the parser is largely inspired by Sean Cribbs [blog posts](http://seancribbs.com/tech/2009/05/27/building-a-parser-generator-in-erlang-part-1/) about PEG parsers in Erlang
